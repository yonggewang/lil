# lil
A project to develop Law of the Iterated Logarithm based testing tools.  

This site is dedicated for techniques, software package, and reports of statistical testing techniques for pseudorandom generators. We developed LIL testing techniques for pseudo-random generator testing. 


# How to:

1. LILtest: this is an Netbean project folder. Import the project into Netbean and follow the instructions
2. compiled_liltest: alternatively, you can download this compiled .jar file and follow the instructions in the README.TXT
